# TODO:
#           - Write code to put multiple images data on one csv
#                   - Is this correct or should I just use multiple csv for training, like one csv per image?
#           - Write code to copy the geojson file when I first get it, like Gabriela said in AI module
#           - Write code to randomly choose bounding boxes to be used for Training or Validation or Testing

# TODO: How To...
#               Save image in QGIS
#               - Project
#               - Import/Export
#               - Export Map to Image
#               - 'Append georeference information (embedded or via world file)' should be green
