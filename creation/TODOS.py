# TODO:
#           - Write code to put multiple images data on one csv
#                   - Is this correct or should I just use multiple csv for training, like one csv per image?
#           - Write code to copy the geojson file when I first get it, like Gabriela said in AI module
#           - Write code to randomly choose bounding boxes to be used for Training or Validation or Testing
